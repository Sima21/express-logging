#First, initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies:
npm init -y
npm install express morgan

##Create the Express App: app.js
##Add Error Handling Middleware, This should be placed after all routes and other middleware

##Run the Application: node app.js
Check if the server is running: http://localhost:3000

###Test the application: Use a tool like Postman or your browser to test the routes:
Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser or send a GET request to that URL using Postman. 
You should get a GET / response.
Send GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to http://localhost:3000/data using Postman to see the different responses.
